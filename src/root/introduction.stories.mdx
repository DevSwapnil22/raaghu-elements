# Introduction

# 👋 Introducing `raaghu-ng-elements` 

`raaghu-ng-elements` is an opensource micro front end framework built on top of Bootstrap 5 and Storybook offering highly customizable and reusable Angular UI elements.

Raaghu elements can be used as a base to build complex components and UI layouts whilst maintaining a high level of reusability.




# 🚀 Demo
Here is a quick [demo](https://www.raaghu.io) of the elements. We hope you enjoy it.

Liked it? Please give us a ⭐️ to show your appreciation

Many Thanks to all the `supporters` who have helped this project with stars(⭐)


# 🔥 Features

## 🔢 High reusability
 - Promotes reusability throughout the UI and pages
 - Reduces code duplication and helps in delivering a more consistent and even UI


## 🏗️ Micro Front End Architecture
- Each element is a separate micro front end on its own
- Elements can be worked on in isolation

## 📢 Theming
- The theming engine provides a way to set custom theme for all the elements
- Control the theme of your project with only a few css variables

## 📱 Responsive and mobile-friendly
- All of the elements are built for a wide variety of screen sizes




# 🏗️ How to Set up `raaghu-ng-elements` for Development?
You can run `raaghu-ng-elements` locally with a few easy steps.

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wai-Technologies/raaghu-ng-elements.git
```

2. Change the working directory

```bash
cd raaghu-ng-elements
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

4. Set localDev environment variable in `envronment.prod.ts` for a particular element
```javascript 
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  localDev: false 
  // serve as micro frontend on 
  // localhost:3000/rds-<element name>/main.js
};
```

5. Build and serve

```bash
# Build all projects and run server
npm run bootstrap 

# Build a single project and start server
npm run bootstrap -- --project=rds-<element name>
# For rds-input
# npm run bootstrap -- --project=rds-input

# Start server without building project
npm run bootstrap -- --build=false
```

5. Storybook

```bash
# View all elements inside storybook
npm run storybook 
```

All set !! Now open `localhost:3000/rds-<element name>` to see the element locally or `localhost:3000/rds-<element name>/main.js` to serve it as a micro front end.
